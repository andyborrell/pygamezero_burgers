===========================================

In this tutorial we'll make a game about catching falling ingredients and building burgers!

If you're just starting out with Python you should start with the `Flappy Bird Tutorial <https://pygamezero-bird.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?>`_.

This tutorial will assume you've already completed the Flappy Bird tutorial so this time we'll skip some of the really basic stuff.  



Getting Started
---------------
Check the beginning of the `Flappy Bird Tutorial <https://pygamezero-bird.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?>`_ for instructions on installing Mu.  


Important tip for using Mu
--------------------------
The first time you save your work in Mu it will open the save dialog in a folder called mu_code.  It's important you save in that exact folder.  If you don't Mu won't be able to run your games. 


Installing Burger Images
------------------------
- Download the tutorial assets by |location_link|. You can close that page once the download finishes.  

- Click on the **Images** button in the Mu editor.  This will open the directory where Pygame Zero looks for images.  

- Copy the burgers folder from the **images.zip** file you just downloaded into this directory.
